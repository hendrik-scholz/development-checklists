# Software Development Checklists

This project was inspired by checklists in aviation. If checklists can help making flying saver, using checklists during software development can help avoiding common mistakes. You can either use the MD files or print out the checklists. If you use the MD files, I recommend using the Visual Studio Code Extension [MarkDown To-Do (Tomas Hubelbauer)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomasHubelbauer.vscode-markdown-todo) to tick the checkboxes on the lists.

# Checklists

These checklists are guidelines and do not cover all the different aspects of the software development life cycle. Feel free to adapt the checklists to your own needs.

The screenshots you can see here contain only parts of the checklists in this repository. If you want to see all items on a checklist,
open that checklist.

## Development Outline

We create outlines for our presentations. So why don't we apply a similar concept for planning the features we are going to implement?

This document contains a list of points to think about before implementing a new feature. Feel free to use a sheet of paper or a whiteboard for your ideas.
