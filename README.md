# development-checklists

development-checklists were inspired by checklists in aviation. If checklists can help making flying saver, using checklists during software development can help avoiding common mistakes. For now, the checklists are made for printing. I am planning to provide the checklists in a different format in the future, e.g. as a web app.

# Checklists

These checklists are guidelines and do not cover all the different aspects of the software development life cycle. Feel free to adapt the checklists to you own needs.

## DevelopmentChecklist

This checklist guides you through the process of implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. The other checklists are referenced in here.

## DevelopmentOutline

We create outlines for your presentations. So why don't we apply a similar concept for planning the features we are going to implement?

This document contains a list of points to think about before implementing a solution. There is some space for your notes, but feel free to get a larger sheet of paper or use a whiteboard for your ideas.

## DevelopmentProgressSheet

This checklist guides you through the process while implementing a new feature or fixing a bug.

## ReleaseChecklist

This checklist guides you through the process of releasing a new version of your software.
