# development-checklists

development-checklists were inspired by checklists in aviation. If checklists can help making flying saver, using checklists during software development can help avoiding common mistakes. For now, the checklists are made for printing. I am planning to provide the checklists in a different format in the future, e.g. as a web app.

# Checklists

These checklists are guidelines and do not cover all the different aspects of the software development life cycle. Feel free to adapt the checklists to your own needs.

## DevelopmentChecklist

This checklist guides you through the process of implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. The other checklists are referenced in here.

## DevelopmentOutline

We create outlines for our presentations. So why don't we apply a similar concept for planning the features we are going to implement?

This document contains a list of points to think about before implementing a new feature. There is some space for your notes, but feel free to get a larger sheet of paper or use a whiteboard for your ideas.

## DevelopmentProgressSheet

This checklist guides you through the process while implementing a new feature or fixing a bug.

## DevelopmentProgressStrips

The development progress strip was inspired by a flight progress strip. The idea is to keep track of the little changes you have to make to implement a new feature.

If you want to break down the tasks on the development outline and the development progress sheet, you can use development
progress strips. A development progress strip can go through different phases, e.g. test, implementation, and submitting to the version control system.

## ReleaseChecklist

This checklist guides you through the process of releasing a new version of your software.

## Performance Optimization Checklist

This checklist guides you through the performance optimization process of your web app.
