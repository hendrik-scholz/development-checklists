# Software Development Checklists

This project was inspired by checklists in aviation. If checklists can help making flying saver, using checklists during software development can help avoiding common mistakes. You can either use the MD files or print out the checklists. If you use the MD files, I recommend using the Visual Studio Code Extension "MarkDown To-Do (Tomas Hubelbauer)" to tick the checkboxes on the lists.

# Checklists

These checklists are guidelines and do not cover all the different aspects of the software development life cycle. Feel free to adapt the checklists to your own needs.

## Bug Fix Progress Sheet

This checklist guides you through the process while fixing a bug.

## Development Checklist

This checklist guides you through the process of implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. The other checklists are referenced in here.

## Development Outline

We create outlines for our presentations. So why don't we apply a similar concept for planning the features we are going to implement?

This document contains a list of points to think about before implementing a new feature. There is some space for your notes, but feel free to get a larger sheet of paper or use a whiteboard for your ideas.

## Development Progress Sheet Backend

This checklist guides you through the process while implementing a new feature in the backend.

## Development Progress Sheet Frontend

This checklist guides you through the process while implementing a new feature in the frontend.

## Development Progress Strips

The development progress strip was inspired by a flight progress strip. The idea is to keep track of the little changes you have to make to implement a new feature.

If you want to break down the tasks on the development outline and the development progress sheet, you can use development
progress strips. A development progress strip can go through different phases, e.g. test, implementation, and submitting to the version control system.
